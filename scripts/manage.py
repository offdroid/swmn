Keep in mind that any raised exceptions might be forwarded to the user.

Under normal circumstances swmn should catch duplicate certificate creation requests or requests on non existent clients/certificates, however, the script should be able to handle these anyway.

    # Arguments
    * `cn` - Common name of the certifacte to generate
    * `passphrase` - [Optional] passphrase for the client certificate
    * `ca_passphrase` - CA passphrase to sign the CSR
    * `data` - [Optional] dictionary with additional options

    # Note
    The certificate should be revoke before it is deleted from the server, to prevent unauthorized access.

    # Arguments
    * `cn` - Common name of the certifacte to revoke
    * `ca_passphrase` - CA passphrase to sign the CSR
